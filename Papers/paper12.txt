abstract
this study investigates a possible way to analyze chat data from
collaborative learning environments using epistemic network
analysis and topic modeling. a 300-topic general topic model
built from tasa (touchstone applied science associates) corpus was used in this study. 300 topic scores for each of the 15,670
utterances in our chat data were computed. seven relevant topics
were selected based on the total document scores. while the aggregated topic scores had some power in predicting students‚Äô
learning, using epistemic network analysis enables assessing the
data from a different angle. the results showed that the topic
score based epistemic networks between low gain students and
high gain students were significantly different (ùë° = 2.00). overall,
the results suggest these two analytical approaches provide complementary information and afford new insights into the processes
related to successful collaborative interactions.

1. introduction
collaborative learning is a special form of learning and interaction
that affords opportunities for groups of students to combine cognitive resources and synchronously or asynchronously participate in
tasks to accomplish shared learning goals [15; 20]. collaborative
learning groups can range from a pair of learners (called a dyad),
to small groups (3-5 learners), to classroom learning (25-35 learners), and more recently large-scale online learning environments
with hundreds or even thousands of students [5; 22]. the collaborative process provides learners with a more efficient learning
experience and improves learners‚Äô collaborative learning skills,
which are critical competencies for students [14]. members in a
team are different in many ways. they have their own experience,
knowledge, skills, and approaches to learning. a student in a col-

laborative learning environment can take other students‚Äô views
and ideas about the information provided in the learning material.
the ideas coming out of the team can then be integrated as a
deeper understanding of the material, or a better solution to a
problem.
traditional collaborative learning occurred in the form of face to
face group discussion or problem solving. as the internet and
learning technologies develop, online collaborative learning environments come out and are playing more and more important
roles. for example, moocs (massive open online courses) have
drawn massive number of learners. learners in moocs are connected by the internet and can easily interact with each other using
various types of tools, such as forums, blogs and social networks
[23]. these digitized environments make it possible to track the
learning processes in collaborative learning environments in
greater detail.
communication is one of the main factors that differentiates collaborative learning from individual learning [4; 6; 9]. as such,
chats from collaborative learning environments provide rich data
that contains information about the dynamics in a learning process. understanding massive chat data from collaborative learning
environments is interesting and challenging. many tools have
been invented and used in chat data analysis, such as liwc (linguistic inquiry and word count) [12], coh-metrix [10], and topic
modeling, just to name a few. epistemic network analysis (ena)
has been playing a unique role in analyzing chat data from epistemic games [18]. ena is rooted in a specific theory of learning:
the epistemic frame theory, in which the collection of skill,
knowledge, identity, value and epistemology (skive) forms an
epistemic frame. a critical theoretical assumption of ena is that
the connections between the elements of epistemic frames are
critical for learning, not their presence in isolation. the online
ena toolkit allows users to analyze chat data by comparing the
connections within the epistemic networks derived from chats.
ena visualization displays the clustering of learners and groups
and the network connections of individual learners and groups.
ena requires coded data which has traditionally relied on hand
coded data sets or classifiers that rely on regular expression mapping. combining topic modeling with ena will provide a new
mode of preparing data sets for analysis using ena.
in this study, we used a combination of topic modeling and ena
to analyze chat data to see if we could detect differences between
the connections made by students with high learning gains versus
students with low learning gains. incorporating topic modeling104

with ena will make the analytic tool more fully automated and of
greater use to the research community.

chats have two obvious features. first, they appear in the form of
text. therefore, any text analysis tool may have a role in chat
analysis. second, chats come from individuals‚Äô interaction, which
reflects social dynamics between participants. therefore, a combination of text analysis and social network analysis should be
helpful in understanding underlying chat dynamics. for instance,
tuulos et al. [21] combined topic modeling with social network
analysis in chat data analysis. they found that topic modeling can
help identify the receiver of chats (the person who a chat is given
to).
in a similar effort, scholand et al. [16] combined liwc and social
network analysis to form a method called ‚Äúsocial language network analysis‚Äù (slna). the social networks were formed by
counting the number of times chat occurred between any two
participants. based on the counts, participants were clustered into
a tree structure, representing the level of subgroups the participants belong to. liwc was then used to get the text features of
chats. it was found that, some liwc features were significantly
different between in group conversations and out of group conversations.
researchers have also recently explored the advantages of combining sna (social network analysis) with deeper level computational linguistic tools, like coh-metrix. coh-metrix computes
over 100 text features. the five most important coh-metrix features are: narrativity, syntax simplicity, word concreteness, referential cohesion and deep cohesion. dowell and colleagues [8]
explored the extent to which characteristics of discourse diagnostically reveals learners‚Äô performance and social position in
moocs. they found that learners who performed significantly
better engaged in more expository style discourse, with surface
and deep level cohesive integration, abstract language, and simple
syntactic structures. however, linguistic profiles of the centrally
positioned learners differed from the high performers. learners
with a more significant and central position in their social network
engaged using a more narrative style discourse with less overlap
between words and ideas, simpler syntactic structures and abstract
words. an increasing methodological contribution of this work
highlights how automated linguistic analysis of student interactions can complement social network analysis (sna) techniques
by adding rich contextual information to the structural patterns of
learner interactions.

final sample. within the population, 50.5% of the sample identified as caucasian, 22.2% as hispanic/latino, 15.4% as asian
american, 4.4% as african american, and less than 1% identified
as either native american or pacific islander.
course details and procedure. students were told that they
would be participating in an assignment that involved a collaborative discussion on personality disorders and taking quizzes. students were told that their assignment was to log into an online
educational platform specific to the university at a specified time,
where they would take quizzes and interact via web chat with one
to four random group members. students were also instructed
that, prior to logging onto the educational platform, they would
have to read material on personality disorders. after logging into
the system, students took a 10 item, multiple choice pretest quiz.
this quiz asked students to apply their knowledge of personality
disorders to various scenarios and to draw conclusions based on
the nature of the disorders. the following is an example of the
types of quiz questions students were exposed to:
ÔÇ∑
ÔÇ∑

ÔÇ∑

jacob was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. why might dr. simon think this was the wrong
diagnosis?
dr. level has measured and described his 10 mice of
varying ages in terms of their length (cm) and weight
(g). how might he describe them on these characteristics using a dimensional approach?
danielle checks her facebook page every hour. does
danielle have narcissistic personality disorder?

after completing the quiz, they were randomly assigned to other
students who were waiting to engage in the chatroom portion of
the task. when there were at least 2 students and no more than 5
students (m = 4.59), individuals were directed to an instant messaging platform that was built into the educational platform. the
group chat began as soon as someone typed the first message and
lasted for 20 minutes. the chat window closed automatically after
20 minutes, at which time students took a second 10 multiplechoice question quiz. each student contributed 154.0 words on
average (sd = 104.9) in 19.5 sentences (sd = 12.5). as a group,
discussions were about 714.8 words long (sd = 235.7) and 90.6
sentences long (sd = 33.5).

in another study, dowell et al. [7] showed that students‚Äô linguistic
characteristics, namely higher degrees of narrativity and deep
cohesion, are predictive of their learning. that is, students engaged in deep cohesive interactions performed better.

art

ok cool, everyone's here. sooo first question

art

ok so the certain characteristics to be considered to
have a personality disorder?

in the present research, we explore collaborative interaction chat
data using the combination of topic modeling and epistemic network analysis. while previous studies focused on the relationship
between language features and social network connections, our
study focuses on prediction learning performance by semantic
network connections students make in chats.

shaffer

alright sooo first question: based on these criteria describe several reasons why a psychologist might not
label someone with grandiose thoughts as having narcissistic personality disorder?

shaffer

hahaha never mind

shaffer

that was the second question.

3. methods

art

lol its all good

shaffer

okay so certain characteristics: doesn't it have to be like
a stable thing?

carl

i think the main thing about having a disorder is that its
disruptive socially and/or makes the person a danger to
himself or others

participants. participants were enrolled in an introductory-level
psychology course taught in the fall semester of 2011 at a large
university in the usa. while 854 students participated in this
course, some minor data loss occurred after removing outliers and
those who failed to complete the outcome measures. the final
sample consisted of 844 students. females made up 64.3% of this105

vasile

yes, stable over time

shaffer

yeah, and it also mentioned it can't be because of drugs

art

also they have to have like unrealistic fantasies

nia

yeah and not normal in their culture

carl

no drugs or physical injury

vasile

begins in early adulthood or adolescence

shaffer

i think that covers them? haha

art

ok, so arrogance doesn't just define it, they have to have
most of these characteristics

art

yeah i think we got them

shaffer

is it most or is it like 6?

from the above excerpt, we can see several obvious things. first,
the lengths of the utterances varied from one single word to multiple sentences. this needs to be considered in text analysis because some methods work only for longer texts. for example,
coh-metrix usually works well for texts with more than 200
words. topic modeling also needs enough length to reliably infer
topic scores. second, the number of utterances each participant
gave were different. from how much and what a member said, we
can see each member played a different role in that chat. third,
the ordered sequence of the utterances forms a time series. understanding and visualizing the underlying discourse dynamics are
important for meaning making with this type of data.
the data set contained 15,670 utterances, pretest scores (the first
quiz) and post test scores (the second quiz) for 844 students,
grouped in 182 chat rooms. each chat room had 2 to 5 students,
4.73 by average. the average speech turns each student gave was
18.2 and the average speech turns in each room was 86.1.
the average pretest score was 36.01% correct and the average
post-test scores 45.73% correct. paired sample test shows that the
post-test is significantly higher (ùë° = 14.13, ùëÅ = 844). we computed the learning gain of each student, using the formula
ùëîùëéùëñùëõ =

ùëùùëúùë†ùë°ùë°ùëíùë†ùë° ùë†ùëêùëúùëüùëí ‚àí ùëùùëüùëíùë°ùëíùë†ùë° ùë†ùëêùëúùëüùëí

.

for all students (ùëÅ = 844), the average learning gain is 0.11,
59.5% had positive learning gains above 0.1. 16.5% had the same
scores and 23% had negative learning gains. not surprisingly,
students who had lower pretest scores had higher learning gains
because they had greater potential to learn. figure 1 shows the
average learning gain as function of pretest score.

this data set has been analyzed in multiple studies. cade et al. [3]
analyzed the cohesion of the chats and found that deep cohesion
of the chats predicts the students feeling of power and connectedness to the group. dowell et al. [7] found that some coh-metrix
measures predicts learning. coh-metrix measures describe common textual features that are not content specific. for example,
cohesion is about how text segments are semantically linked to
each other, which has nothing to do with what the text content is
about. in this study, we use topic modeling to provide content
dependent features and use epistemic network analysis to explore
how the topics were associated in the chats.

4. topic modeling
topic modeling has been widely used in text analysis to find what
topics are in a text and what proportion/amount of each topic is
contained. latent dirichlet allocation (lda) [2; 24] is one of the
most popular methods for topic modeling. lda uses a generative
process to find topic representations. lda starts from a large
document set ùê∑ = {ùëë1 , ùëë2 , ‚ãØ , ùëëùëö }. a word list ùëä =
{ùë§1 , ùë§2 , ‚ãØ , ùë§ùëõ } is then extracted from the document set. lda
assumes that the document set contains a certain number of topics,
say, k topics. each document has a probability distribution over
the k topics and each topic has a probability distribution over the
given list of words. when a document was composed, each word
that occurred in a document was assumed to be drawn based on
the document-topic probability and the topic-word probability.
for a given corpus (document set) and a given number of topics
k, lda can compute the topic assignment of each word in each
document.
for a given topic, the word probability distribution can be easily
computed from the number of times each word was assigned to
the given topic. the beauty of topic modeling is that the ‚Äútop
words‚Äù (words with highest probabilities in a topic) usually give a
meaningful interpretation of a topic. the distributions are the
underlying representation of the topics. the top words are usually
used to show what topics are contained in the corpus.
by counting the number of words assigned to each topic, a topic
proportion score can be computed for each document on each
topic. the topic proportion scores then become a document feature that can be used in further analysis. however, the proportion
scores are based on the statistical topic assignment of words.
when documents are very short, such as most utterances in our
chat data, the topic proportion scores won‚Äôt be reliable. cai et al.
[4] argued that alternative ways to compute document topic scores
are possible.

figure 1. average learning gain as a function of pretest score.

although our chat data set contained 15,670 utterances, the utterances were short and the corpus is not large enough to build a
reliable topic model. to get a reliable model, we used a well
known corpus provided by tasa (touchstone applied science
associates). this corpus contained documents on seven known
categories, including business, health, home economics, industrial
arts, language arts, science and social studies. our content topic,
personality disorders, is obviously in the health category. of
course, not all topics in tasa are relevant to our study. therefore, after building up the model, we need to select relevant topics. we will cover that in the next sub-section.106

there are a total of 37,651 documents in tasa corpus, each of
which is about 250 words long. before we ran lda, we filtered
out very high frequency words and very low frequency words.
high frequency words, such as ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúof‚Äù, ‚Äúin‚Äù, etc., won‚Äôt contain much topic information. rare words won‚Äôt contribute to
meaningful statistics. 28,483 words (it might be better to say
‚Äúterms‚Äù) were left after filtering. a model with 300 topics was
constructed by lda.

4.2 topic score computation and topic selection
from the tasa topic model, we computed the word-topic probabilities based on the number of times a word was assigned to each
of the 300 topics. thus, each word is represented by a 300 dimensional probability distribution vector. for each chat in our chat
corpus, we simply summed up the word probability vectors for the
words appeared in each chat. that gave us 300 topic scores for
each chat. recall that, the chats were associated with a reading
material and two quizzes. while the students were free to talk
about anything, the content of the reading material and the quizzes
set up the main chat topics, that is, personality disorders.

figure 2. sorted topic scores for topic selection.
the first thing we needed to do then was to investigate whether or
not the ‚Äúhot‚Äù topics from the computation made sense. to find
that out, we computed the sum of all topic scores over all chats.
the topics were sorted according the total topic score. the hottest
topic had a total score higher than 1300, much higher than the
second highest (less than 900). by examining the top words, this
topic is about ‚Äúillness‚Äù, which is highly relevant to personality
disorders. six hot topics scored in the range from 600 to 900.
they are about ‚Äúoutdoors‚Äù, ‚Äúbiology‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople/social‚Äù, ‚Äúeducation‚Äù and ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù. the top words are listed below.

‚Äúillness‚Äù, ‚Äúbiology‚Äù, ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù and ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù are the topics
the learning materials involved. ‚Äúeducation‚Äù topic is about the
education environment where the chat happened. ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù and
‚Äúpeople/social‚Äù are off-task topics.
to get an idea about whether or not the topic scores were related
to the learning gain, we aggregated the scores by person and computed the correlation between the total topic score and the learning
gain for each topic. we were only interested in looking at the
students with larger potential to learn, so we removed the data
with pretest score greater than or equal to 0.5, leaving 624 students out of 844. the results (table 1) showed that all topics were
significantly correlated to learning gain. it doesn‚Äôt seem to be
great, because that seems to suggest that, whatever topic a student
talked about, more a student talked, larger gain the student obtained. the real reason is that in the aggregation, all topic scores
were summed up. therefore, all topic scores were influenced by
the chat length. so the correlation in table 2 basically showed the
chat length effect.

to remove the chat length effect, the simplest way is to divide all
scores by the number of words (terms) in each chat. however, in
this study, to be consistent with subsequent analysis, we normalized the topic scores to topic proportion scores by dividing each
topic score for each utterance by the sum of all seven topic scores
of the same utterance.
the results (table 3) showed that the topic ‚Äúpeople/social‚Äù had a
significant negative correlation to learning gain. others were not
significant but were in the direction we would expect. ‚Äúillness‚Äù,
‚Äúbiology‚Äù, ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù and ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù were positively correlated with gain scores, while ‚Äúoutdoors‚Äù and ‚Äúpeople/social‚Äù topics were negatively correlated with gains scores. we observed
almost no correlation for the ‚Äúeducation‚Äù topic. this seems to
indicate that the aggregated topic scores have limited power in
predicting learning. therefore, we used ena to examine the connections or association of these topics in the students discourse to107

develop a predictive model of learning gains based on the use of
these topics.

5. epistemic network analysis
ena measures the connections between elements in data and
represents them in dynamic network models. ena creates these
network models in a metric space that enables the comparison of
networks in terms of (a) difference graph that highlights how the
weighted connections of one network differ from another; and (b)
statistics that summarize the weighted structure of network connections, enabling comparisons of many networks at once.
ena was originally developed to model cognitive networks involved in complex thinking. these cognitive networks represent
associations between knowledge, skills, habits of mind of individual learners or groups of learners. in this study, we used ena to
construct network models. for each individual student, we constructed an ena network using the selected seven topic scores for
each utterance the student contributed to the group.

5.1 process
while the process of creating ena models is described in more
detail elsewhere (e.g. [11; 17-19]), we will briefly describe how
ena models are created based on topic modeling. here we defined network nodes as the seven topics identified from the topic
model. we defined the connections between nodes, or edges, as
the strength of the co-occurrence of topics within a moving stanza
window (msw) of size 5 [19]. to model connections between
topics we used the products of the topic scores summed across all
chats in the msw. that is, for each topic, the topic scores are
summed across all 5 chats in the msw. then ena computed the
product of the summed topic loadings for each pair topics to
measure the strength of their co-occurrence. for example, if the
sum of the topics scores across five chats was 0.5 for ‚Äúillness‚Äù, 0.3
for ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù, and 0.2 for ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù, these scores would
result in three co-occurrences, ‚Äúillness-psychology‚Äù, ‚Äúillnesshealthcare‚Äù, and ‚Äúpsychology-healthcare‚Äù, with scores of 0.15,
0.1, and 0.06, respectively.
next ena created adjacency matrices for each student that quantified the co-occurrences of topics within the students‚Äô discourse
in the context of their chat group. subsequently, the adjacency
matrices were then treated as vectors in a high dimensional space,
where each dimension corresponds to co-occurrence of a pair of
topics. the vectors were then normalized to unit vectors. notice
that the normalization removed the effect of chat length embedded
in the topic scores. a singular value decomposition (svd) was
then performed for dimensional reduction. ena then projected a
vector for each student into a low dimensional space that maximizes the variance explained in the data. finally, the nodes of the

networks, which in this case correspond to the seven selected
topics generated from tasa corpus, were placed in the low dimensional space. the topic nodes were placed using an optimization algorithm such that the overall distances between centroids
(centers of the mass of the networks) and the corresponding projected student locations was minimized. a critical feature of ena
is that these node placements are fixed, that is, the nodes of each
network are in the same place for all units in the analysis. this
fixing of the location of the nodes allows for meaningful comparisons between networks in terms of their connection patterns
which allow us to interpret the metric space. as a result, ena
produced two coordinated representations: (1) the location of each
student in a projected metric space, in which all units of analysis
included in the model were located, and (2) weighted network
graphs for each student, which explained why the student was
positioned where it was in the space.
ena also allows us to compare the mean network graphs and
mean position in ena space between different groups of students. in this study, we only considered the students with high
potential to learn, i.e., the 624 students with pretest score < 0.5
(50% correct). among these students, we compared the networks
of low learning gain students (gain<-0.1, ùëÅ=194) with the networks of high learning gain students (gain>0.43, ùëÅ=105). we
compared these groups using difference network graph, which
was formed by subtracting the edge weights of the mean discourse
network for the low gain group students from the mean discourse
network from the high gain group. this difference network graph
shows us which topic connections are stronger for each group. in
addition, we conducted a t-test to test the difference between
group means.

5.2 results
figure 3 shows mean discourse networks for students with low
gain scores (left, red), students with high gain scores (right, blue),
and a difference network graph (center) that shows how the discourse patterns of each group differs. students with low gains had
stronger connections between the ‚Äúpeople/social‚Äù topic and all
other topics except for ‚Äúillness‚Äù. more importantly, the connection that was the strongest for low gain students compared to high
gain students was between ‚Äúpeople/social‚Äù and ‚Äúoutdoors‚Äù. students with high gain scores made stronger connections between
the topics of ‚Äúillness‚Äù, ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù, ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù, ‚Äúbiology‚Äù, and
‚Äúeducation‚Äù.

figure 4 shows centroids, or the centers of mass, of individual
students‚Äô discourse networks and their means with low gain score
students in red and high gain score students in blue. the differences between these two groups were significant on the x dimensions (see table 4). this means that the differences we saw in
figure 2 and described above are statistically significant. in other
words, the high learning gain students‚Äô discourse was more towards the right side of the ena space and the low learning gain
students‚Äô discourse was more towards the left side. that indicates
that the discourse of students with high learning gains made more
connections between on-task topics (‚Äúillness‚Äù, ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù,
‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù, ‚Äúbiology‚Äù, and ‚Äúeducation‚Äù), while the discourse of108

low gain students made more connections between off-task topics
(‚Äúpeople/social‚Äù and ‚Äúoutdoors‚Äù).

6. discussion
ena makes it possible to visualize the chat dynamics to help
researchers gain deeper understanding of what is going on in a
collaborative learning environment. differences in what topics
students connect in discourse can predict learning outcomes. previous use of ena has relied on human coded data or use of regular expressions to classify data. utilizing topic modeling can lead
to fully automated ena, making it more accessible to a wider
group of researchers and allows ena to be used with more and
larger data sets.
the fact that the epistemic network predicts learning validates
further application of ena. for example, the turn by turn chat
dynamics can be plotted as trajectories in the 2-d space, where the

topics are placed. investigating the trajectory patterns and their
relationship to learning or socio-affective components are interesting future research directions.
we used a general topic model in this study. many studies in the
literature used lda for topic modeling on relatively small corpora. this causes two problems. 1) lda topic models built upon
small corpora are not reliable, because lda requires large number documents with relatively large size for each document. inadequate corpus can result in misleading results. 2) using a topic
model that is not common would result in arbitrary interpretation.
for example, the representation of ‚Äúillness‚Äù from different corpus
could be very different. therefore, it is hard to compare the claims
made to ‚Äúillness‚Äù across different studies. using a reliable, common topic models will set up a common language for different
studies.

chat utterances are too short. the statistical inference algorithm
contains a high degree of randomness for short documents. as an
extreme example, an utterance with a single word, would result in
inferred topic proportion scores with ‚Äú1‚Äù on one topic and ‚Äú0‚Äù on
others. the problem is that, this ‚Äú1‚Äù was assigned to a topic with
certain degree of uncertainty. that is, the topic this ‚Äú1‚Äù was assigned to could be any topic. while aggregated analysis may not
be sensitive to such uncertainty, detailed utterance by utterance
analysis would suffer from it.
our method of computing topic scores is based on the topic probability distribution over each word. we treat the topic distribution
of each word as a vector. when computing the topic score, the
simple sum of all word vectors gives scores to all topics. as we
have pointed out, the summation algorithm will have a length
effect. therefore, when such topic scores are used, removing
length effects through normalization is necessary. in this article,
we did not use weighted sum as suggested in cai et al. [4]. comparing the effect of different weighting is beyond the scope of this
paper.

topic scores for documents are usually inferred from topic models. while for longer documents, the topic scores can be used in
many applications (e.g., text clustering [1]), the inferred topic
proportion scores won‚Äôt be useful for analyzing chats if we need
to treat each utterance as a unit of analysis. it is not useful because

when a general topic model is used, selecting topics relevant to
the specific analysis becomes important. our approach was to
look at the total scores of utterances and find the ‚Äúhot‚Äù topics by
sorting the total topic scores. in our study, we had a quickly decreasing curve that helped us to select topics. we believe this
would be the case for most studies using a model containing far
more topics than the topics contained in the target data.109

although our study started with topic modeling to capture the
‚Äúwhat‚Äù in the chats, the association networks constructed in the
epistemic network analysis actually turned the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù into a
‚Äúhow‚Äù: how the topics in the chats associated with each other.
this is conceptually similar to the cohesion features dowell [7]
and cade [3] used.
topic modeling emphasizes content words. when a topic model is
built, stop words are usually removed. an interesting question is,
what if we do the opposite: keep stop words and remove content
words? pennebaker (e.g., [13]) laid foundational work in this direction. the liwc tool pennebaker and his colleagues created
provides over a hundred text measures by counting non-content
words. liwc measures could provide different features to epistemic network analysis and reveal different aspects of the chat
dynamics.
